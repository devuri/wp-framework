To run only a specific test (such as your `ResponseTest`):

### 1. **Run a Specific Test Class**

If you want to run just the `ResponseTest` class, you can specify the path to the test file when running PHPUnit:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Component/Http/Message/ResponseTest.php --testdox
```

### 2. **Run a Specific Test Method in a Class**

If you want to run a specific method within the `ResponseTest`, you can use the `--filter` option and provide the method name:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testGetProtocolVersion tests/ResponseTest.php
```

This will run only the `testGetProtocolVersion` method inside the `ResponseTest.php` file.


### 3. **Run All Tests with a Pattern**

You can also run all test files that match a certain pattern using `--filter`. For example, to run all tests containing the word "Response":

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter Response
```

This will run all test methods across all files that contain "Response" in the method or class name.

These methods will help you isolate and run only the tests youâ€™re interested in.
