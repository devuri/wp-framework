# Proposal: Custom Error Numbering System for Easier Debugging and Support

## Objective
Introduce a simple error numbering system to help users and support teams quickly identify, reference, and resolve issues using standard error codes.

---

## Background
Currently, users describe errors vaguely or provide screenshots, making it hard for support teams to resolve issues efficiently. A numbering system can:

1. Simplify error communication.
2. Speed up troubleshooting.
3. Improve user satisfaction.

This system will be inspired by HTTP response codes but customized for our application.

---

## Proposed System
### Structure of Error Codes
Error codes will have two parts:

**`[Range]-[Unique ID]`**

- **Range:** Defines the error category (e.g., validation, server).
- **Unique ID:** A sequential number unique to that category.

---

### Numbering Ranges
| **Range**   | **Category**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1000–1999** | **Informational**             | Warnings or guidance (e.g., incomplete actions).                                |
| **2000–2999** | **Validation Errors**         | User input issues (e.g., missing data, invalid formats).                        |
| **3000–3999** | **Authentication/Permission** | Errors related to login, authentication, or access permissions.                 |
| **4000–4999** | **Application Logic**         | Issues tied to business rules or app constraints (e.g., quotas, limits).        |
| **5000–5999** | **Server/Infrastructure**     | Server-side problems or unexpected failures.                                    |
| **6000–6999** | **External Dependencies**     | Errors caused by third-party services or integrations.                          |

---

### Example Errors
#### Informational (1000–1999)
| **Error Code** | **Description**                      | **Example**                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1001           | Action pending approval.            | User's account is awaiting admin approval.  |
| 1002           | Processing incomplete.              | Background tasks are still ongoing.         |

#### Validation Errors (2000–2999)
| **Error Code** | **Description**                      | **Example**                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2001           | Missing required fields.            | Username or email missing in form.          |
| 2002           | Invalid format.                     | Email or phone number format is incorrect.  |

#### Server/Infrastructure (5000–5999)
| **Error Code** | **Description**                      | **Example**                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 5001           | Service unavailable.                | Server is down for maintenance.             |
| 5002           | Timeout error.                      | Request took too long to process.           |

## Benefits
1. **Better Communication:** Users can reference error codes, reducing confusion.
2. **Faster Support:** Support teams can identify recurring issues more easily.
3. **Improved Documentation:** A list of codes helps users and developers troubleshoot.
4. **Scalable:** New error codes can be added without disrupting the system.

---

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Design
1. List current application errors.
2. Assign codes to each error based on the proposed structure.

### Phase 2: Development
1. Update error messages to include codes.
2. Create a reference document for error codes.

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. Deploy the updated error system.
2. Train support staff and update user-facing help documentation.

---

## Conclusion
This error numbering system will improve communication and troubleshooting, benefiting both users and support teams. It provides a scalable framework for managing errors as our application grows. We recommend implementing this feature to enhance the user experience and support process.
