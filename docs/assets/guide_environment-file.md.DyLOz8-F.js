The choice of file name is primarily for organizational convenience, reflecting the environment they are intended for. Here&#39;s an overview of the supported environment file names and their typical use cases:</p><ol><li><p><strong><code>env</code> or <code>.env</code></strong>: Commonly used names for environment files, especially in production environments. They typically contain the essential configurations necessary for the application to run.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>.env.local</code> or <code>env.local</code></strong>: Typically used for local development settings. These files can contain overrides for database connections, debugging tools, and other developer-specific configurations. They are often excluded from version control to maintain developer-specific settings locally.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>.env.dev</code></strong>: Suggested for development environments where the focus is on continuous development, testing, and integration. Settings might include detailed logging and debugging options.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>.env.staging</code></strong>: Used in staging environments to replicate production settings closely with the potential inclusion of pre-production testing configurations.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>.env.prod</code></strong>: Tailored for production environments, focusing on security, performance, and scalability.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>.env.debug</code></strong>: This file can be used during intensive debugging sessions requiring verbose logging and error reporting.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>.env.secure</code></strong>: The naming suggests heightened security, but it&#39;s treated like any other environment file by the framework. It can be used as needed within your team&#39;s workflow.</p></li></ol><h3 id="loading-order-and-precedence" tabindex="-1">Loading Order and Precedence <a class="header-anchor" href="#loading-order-and-precedence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Loading Order and Precedence&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The framework searches for these files in the listed order, loading the first one it finds.
