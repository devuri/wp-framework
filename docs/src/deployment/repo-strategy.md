# Bare Repository Strategy

This guide details the process of deploying a Raydium-based WordPress site using GitHub and GitHub Actions with a bare repository strategy. Although GitHub and GitHub Actions are used in this example, similar steps can be applied to other platforms like GitLab CI, Jenkins, or Bitbucket Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- A remote server with SSH access.
- Git installed on both your local machine and the remote server.
- Basic knowledge of Git, SSH, and Raydium's WPFramework.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Local Raydium Project

1. **Initialize a Raydium Project:**
   ```bash
   composer create-project devuri/raydium my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Initialize a Git Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **Create a Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Follow the instructions to add the remote repository to your local Git setup:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

### 2. Set Up the Bare Repository on the Remote Server

1. **Connect to Your Remote Server:**
   ```bash
   ssh user@yourserver.com
   ```

2. **Create a Bare Repository:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/bare-repo
   cd /path/to/bare-repo
   git init --bare
   ```

### 3. Create a Post-Receive Hook

The post-receive hook will automate the deployment by copying files from the bare repository to your web directory.

1. **Navigate to the Hooks Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/bare-repo/repo.git/hooks
   ```

2. **Create the Post-Receive Hook:**
   ```bash
   touch post-receive
   nano post-receive
   ```

3. **Add the Following Script to the Hook:**

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Set variables
   TARGET="/path/to/your/web/directory"
   GIT_DIR="/path/to/bare-repo/repo.git"
   WORK_DIR="/path/to/tmp/work/directory"

   # Create the work directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p $WORK_DIR

   # Checkout the latest code into the work directory
   git --work-tree=$WORK_DIR --git-dir=$GIT_DIR checkout -f

   # Copy the files to the target directory
   rsync -av --delete $WORK_DIR/ $TARGET/

   # Set permissions (optional, adjust as needed)
   chown -R www-data:www-data $TARGET
   ```

4. **Make the Hook Executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x post-receive
   ```

### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   In your repository, create a directory for GitHub Actions workflows:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Create a Deployment Workflow File:**
   ```bash
   nano .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```

3. **Add the Following Workflow Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to Server

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up SSH
         uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
         with:
           ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

       - name: Deploy to Server
         run: |
           ssh user@yourserver.com 'cd /path/to/bare-repo/repo.git && git pull origin main'
   ```

4. **Add Your SSH Key to GitHub Secrets:**
   - Set up [SSH keys](/deployment/ssh-keys) for your deployment.
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings.
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - Add a new secret named `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and paste your private SSH key.

### 5. Push Your Code and Deploy

1. **Push Your Code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

   The GitHub Actions workflow will run, connecting to your remote server and triggering the post-receive hook to copy the files to your web directory.

### 6. Verify the Deployment

1. **Check the Target Directory:**
   Ensure that the files have been copied correctly to the target directory on the remote server.

2. **Visit Your Website:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to your website to confirm that it is working as expected.

## Additional Tips

- **Automate with Other CI/CD Tools:** If you're using GitLab CI, Jenkins, or Bitbucket Pipelines, adapt the workflow to the specific platform. The general steps remain the same: configure SSH access, set up a deployment script, and trigger the deployment on code push.
- **Environment Configuration:** Use Raydium’s environment configuration features to manage different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Security:** Ensure your SSH keys are secure and your server permissions are correctly set to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Raydium-Specific Configuration:** Utilize Raydium’s WPFramework for additional configuration and optimization to leverage its full potential.

This will setup a robust deployment process tailored to Raydium using GitHub and GitHub Actions. This method leverages Git’s powerful version control system and Raydium’s capabilities, ensuring your WordPress site is always up-to-date and consistent across environments.
