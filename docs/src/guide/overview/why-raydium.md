# Why Raydium?

Raydium is a **micro-infrastructure framework** designed to enhance WordPress by providing a structured, scalable foundation for handling requests, setting up environments, improving security, and supporting multi-tenancy. Raydium  allows developers to modernize their workflow without overwhelming complexity or unnecessary features.

Here’s why Raydium is an ideal choice as a micro-infrastructure framework:

## 1. **Non-Intrusive, Modular Framework**
   - Raydium isn’t a monolithic framework that seeks to control the entire application lifecycle. Instead, it’s **non-intrusive**, meaning it doesn’t replace WordPress but works alongside it, enhancing its infrastructure without adding unnecessary complexity.
   - Its **modular, micro-infrastructure** approach allows for targeted improvements in scaling, security, and multi-tenancy, offering essential enhancements without burdening developers with excessive features.

## 2. **Infrastructure Layer Management**
   - Raydium manages the **pre-initialization process**, overseeing constants, environment variables, and error handling, which are vital to any web application's infrastructure.
   - It also offers an optional **multi-tenancy layer**, enabling WordPress to serve multiple tenants from a single instance. This is a high-level infrastructure feature common in modern frameworks, making WordPress more versatile for complex deployments.

## 3. **Separation of Responsibilities**
   - Raydium separates infrastructure-related concerns from WordPress itself, allowing WordPress to focus on content management. Core infrastructure tasks like **error handling**, **environment configuration**, and **security** are managed by Raydium, leaving WordPress free to operate more efficiently.
   - Acting as a **middleware framework**, Raydium provides the architecture patterns and services WordPress needs but does not natively offer, such as advanced environment setup and request handling.

## 4. **Modern Development Practices**
   - Raydium bridges the gap between traditional WordPress development and modern software engineering principles. It incorporates **modern practices** such as environment configuration via `.env` files, **multi-tenancy support**, and a **kernel-based architecture**—all of which are common in modern PHP frameworks.
   - The framework is designed to support **CI/CD workflows** and **Composer-based dependency management**, streamlining development and deployment processes for WordPress developers.

## 5. **Enhanced Security**
   - In today's digital landscape, **security** is a top priority. Raydium places a strong emphasis on securing WordPress sites by abstracting common vulnerabilities and adhering to security best practices.
   - By incorporating security at the infrastructure level, Raydium provides a more secure foundation from the start, protecting your WordPress sites from potential threats.

## 6. **Seamless WordPress Integration**
   - Despite adding a new layer of functionality, Raydium is designed to **seamlessly integrate** with WordPress. Developers can continue to leverage the extensive WordPress ecosystem, including plugins and themes, without sacrificing efficiency, scalability, or compatibility.
   - Raydium enhances WordPress’s capabilities without disrupting its familiar workflow or tools, offering a harmonious balance between new features and the WordPress core.
   - Efficient, with an average execution time of approximately 0.027 seconds (27 milliseconds).

## 7. **Targeted Enhancements**
   - Raydium focuses on specific areas, such as request/response management, environment setup, and multi-tenancy. It performs these tasks **before WordPress is bootstrapped**, ensuring they don’t interfere with the core functionality of WordPress itself.
   - By sitting **in front of WordPress**, Raydium acts as a gatekeeper, handling critical infrastructure tasks like scaling and security that enhances WordPress’s native capabilities, without overhauling its core structure.

In summary, Raydium provides a lightweight, scalable, and structured approach to WordPress development. It enhances WordPress with modern infrastructure practices, including security, scalability, and development efficiency, while keeping its core intact. This makes Raydium the ideal choice for developers who want to modernize their WordPress sites without fundamentally altering the way WordPress works.
