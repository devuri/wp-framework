# Update Your Raydium Site

This document outlines the process and best practices for updating WordPress, plugins, and themes using Composer. Keeping your installation and its components up-to-date is crucial for maintaining security, performance, and access to new features. This guide will help you understand how to manage updates efficiently.

## Managing Updates

Using Composer for WordPress and plugin updates in a version-controlled environment can provide significant security and operational benefits. This approach allows your team to review and manage updates more effectively, ensuring that any changes are thoroughly vetted before being deployed to your live website.

### Setting Up a Version-Controlled Environment

1. **Repository Initialization:**
   - **Create a Git Repository:** Initialize a Git repository for your Raydium-powered WordPress website.
   - **Include Plugins and Themes (Optionally):** Add your plugins and themes to the repository, ensuring that each is properly tracked.

2. **Composer for Dependency Management:**
   - **Composer Setup:** Use Composer to manage your WordPress plugins and themes.
   - **Packagist and WPackagist:** Utilize Packagist or WPackagist to include WordPress plugins and themes in your `composer.json` file. This makes it easy to install and update them.

3. **Updating and Reviewing Plugins:**
   - **Composer Update:** Run `composer update` to fetch the latest versions of your dependencies. This command updates the `composer.lock` file with the exact versions of each plugin.
   - **Code Review:** With all changes tracked in Git, your team can review the updates before merging them into the main branch. This ensures that any changes introduced by plugin updates are scrutinized for potential issues or security concerns.

    ```bash
    composer update wpackagist-plugin/xyz-plugin
    git add composer.json composer.lock
    git commit -m "Update XYZ plugin to the latest version"
    ```

4. **Deployment:**
   - **Staging Environment:** Deploy the updated code to a staging environment for testing. This allows your team to verify that the updates do not introduce any issues before going live.
   - **Production Deployment:** Once verified, merge the changes into the production branch and deploy the updates to the live site.

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Enhanced Security:**
   - **Controlled Updates:** By managing updates through version control, your team can review and approve changes before they are applied, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
   - **Rollback Capability:** If an update causes issues, it’s easy to roll back to a previous version using Git, ensuring minimal disruption to your site.

2. **Improved Transparency:**
   - **Audit Trail:** Git provides a detailed history of all changes, making it easy to track what updates were applied and when.
   - **Collaboration:** Team members can collaborate more effectively by reviewing code changes and providing feedback through pull requests.

3. **Automation and Efficiency:**
   - **Automated Updates:** Composer automates the process of fetching and installing updates, reducing manual effort.
   - **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate CI tools to automatically test updates in a staging environment, ensuring that changes meet your quality standards before deployment.

### Potential Challenges

1. **Initial Setup Complexity:**
   - Setting up Composer and version control for a WordPress site may require a learning curve, especially for teams unfamiliar with these tools.

2. **Maintenance Overhead:**
   - Regularly updating and reviewing plugins can add to the workload, but this is mitigated by the increased security and stability it provides.

## Updating WordPress Core

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Check Current Version**: Verify the current version of WordPress installed by checking your `composer.json` file.

2. **Update WordPress Core**: Use Composer to update WordPress to the latest version.
    ```bash
    composer update johnpbloch/wordpress
    ```

3. **Database Migrations**: If the update includes database changes, ensure you have any necessary scripts to run the migrations.

4. **Clear Cache**: Clear any cached data to ensure the changes take effect. This can typically be done within your caching plugin or service.

5. **Verify Update**: Confirm the update was successful by checking the version in your site’s admin dashboard.

## Updating Plugins and Themes

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Check for Updates**: Review your site to see when plugins and themes have available updates.

2. **Update Plugins and Themes**: Use Composer to update plugins and themes to their latest versions.
    ```bash
    composer update wpackagist-plugin/xyz-plugin wpackagist-theme/xyz-theme
    ```

3. **Verify Updates**: Confirm the updates were successful by checking the versions in your site’s admin dashboard.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular maintenance windows to check for and apply updates.
- **Monitor Security Advisories**: Stay informed about security advisories related to WordPress, and any plugins/themes you use.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing in your staging environment to quickly identify issues after updates.
- **Documentation**: Keep a record of updates applied, including versions and any issues encountered.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Update Conflicts**: Conflicts can arise from dependencies or custom modifications. Resolve conflicts by checking the update logs and applying necessary fixes.
2. **Performance Issues**: If performance degrades after an update, check for any deprecated functions or compatibility issues.
