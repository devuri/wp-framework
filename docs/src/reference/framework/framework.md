## Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4
- Composer for dependency management
- WordPress 5.2 or higher

## Installation
1. **Create a `.env` File**: In your project's root, create a `.env` [environment file](../customization/environment-file) to define essential configuration constants, including database settings and other environment-specific variables.

    ```dotenv
   HOME_URL='https://example.com'
    WP_SITEURL="${HOME_URL}/wp"
    ENVIRONMENT_TYPE='production'
    DB_NAME='wp_database'
    DB_USER='your_db_user'
    DB_PASSWORD='your_db_password'
    DB_HOST='localhost'
    ```

2. **Install WPFramework**:
    Use Composer to install WPFramework in your project directory.

    ```bash
    composer require devuri/wpframework
    ```

## Configuration and Usage
After installation, integrate WPFramework into your WordPress setup:

1. **Bootstrap WPFramework**: Create a setparate `bootstrap.php` or include these the Initialization in your `wp-config.php` file, this will ensure framework is loaded and initialized correctly.

    ```php
    // Include Composer autoload.
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    // Initialize WPFramework.
    $http_app = wpframework(__DIR__);

    // Override default settings if necessary.
    $http_app->overrides();

    // Initiate WPFramework.
    $http_app->init();

    // Set WordPress database table prefix.
    $table_prefix = env('DB_PREFIX', 'wp_');
    ```

2. **Activate Multi-Tenancy (Optional)**: If you're utilizing WPFramework's multi-tenancy features, ensure your `.env` file and other configurations align with multi-tenant requirements. Refer to the [Multi-Tenancy Guide](../multi-tenant/overview) for detailed instructions.

3. **Development and Deployment**: Develop your WordPress site as usual. the framework works behind the scenes, providing a secure, scalable, and modular environment.
