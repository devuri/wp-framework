# Managing Updates in Raydium Framework

## Overview

The Raydium Framework enhances the WordPress development experience by integrating modern development practices, including dependency management and automated workflows. One of the core benefits of using Raydium is the granular control it offers over application updates, notably through the use of Composer and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This document outlines best practices for managing updates within the Raydium Framework, emphasizing the importance of leveraging these tools for a more controlled, secure, and efficient update process.

## Updates via Composer

### Why Use Composer for Updates?

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages them for you. Using Composer for updates in Raydium offers several advantages:

- **Dependency Management:** Composer ensures that all your project's dependencies are compatible, reducing the risk of conflicts and errors.
- **Version Control:** With Composer, you can specify which versions of each package your project requires, giving you precise control over updates.
- **Automation:** Composer automates the process of downloading, installing, and updating libraries, saving time and reducing manual errors.
- **Security:** Regular updates through Composer help keep your project secure by incorporating the latest patches and security fixes from dependency libraries.

### Implementing Updates with Composer

To manage updates with Composer in the Raydium Framework:

1. **Specify Dependencies:** In your project's `composer.json` file, list all the WordPress plugins, themes, and other PHP libraries your project depends on, along with their desired versions.

2. **Run Composer Update:** To update your project dependencies, run the `composer update` command in your project root. This command checks for newer versions of your dependencies within the constraints you've defined and updates them accordingly.

3. **Test Updates:** After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the updates haven't introduced any issues.

4. **Commit `composer.lock`:** Commit the updated `composer.lock` file to your version control system to ensure that all team members and deployment environments use the same versions of dependencies.

## Updates via CI/CD Pipeline

### Why Incorporate CI/CD for Updates?

Incorporating a CI/CD pipeline for updates automates the process of testing, building, and deploying your Raydium-based application, providing several benefits:

- **Automated Testing:** CI/CD pipelines can automatically run a suite of tests against your codebase whenever updates are made, ensuring that updates do not break existing functionality.
- **Consistent Builds:** By automating the build process, CI/CD ensures that every deployment is consistent and based on the codebase's current state, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Streamlined Deployment:** CI/CD pipelines can automatically deploy updates to various environments (e.g., staging, production), making the deployment process faster and more reliable.
- **Rollback Capabilities:** In case of issues, CI/CD pipelines can facilitate quick rollbacks to previous stable versions.

### Implementing Updates with CI/CD

To leverage CI/CD pipelines for updates in the Raydium Framework:

1. **Configure the Pipeline:** Set up your CI/CD pipeline in your preferred tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) with steps for testing, building, and deploying your application.

2. **Automate Testing:** Define tests to automatically run against your application when changes are detected. This could include unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests.

3. **Automate Composer Updates:** Incorporate a step in your pipeline to run `composer update` and update your application's dependencies according to the constraints defined in `composer.json`.

4. **Build and Deploy:** Configure your pipeline to automatically build your application and deploy it to the appropriate environments after successful tests and updates.

5. **Monitor and Rollback:** Implement monitoring for your deployed application and establish a process for rolling back to previous versions if issues arise post-deployment.

> By utilizing Composer and CI/CD pipelines, the Raydium Framework provides a robust and modern approach to managing updates in WordPress development projects. This method offers significant advantages in terms of dependency management, automation, and security, aligning with best practices in software development. By adopting these strategies, developers can ensure that their applications remain up-to-date, secure, and performant, with minimal manual intervention and reduced risk of errors.
